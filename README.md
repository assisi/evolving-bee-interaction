Code to be used in the ASSISIbf 2017 Summer School *Engineering and Evolution of Bio-Hybrid Societies* practical *Engineering and Design Choices in the Evolution of Robot-Bee Interaction*.

The code in this repository is an adapted version of the code used in experiments to evolve robot controllers using bees as fitness providers.
This code is in a private repository.

Students that want to attend this practical can find more information about the code they are going to work on in
